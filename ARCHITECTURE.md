# Voice Control System Architecture

## Core Components

### 1. Voice System (Persistent)
- Initializes once at program start
- Runs continuously in background
- Handles voice recognition
- Only cleaned up at program exit

### 2. Microphone Control (Toggle)
- Simple on/off control
- No impact on voice system
- Clear state management
- User-facing controls

### 3. System Flow
